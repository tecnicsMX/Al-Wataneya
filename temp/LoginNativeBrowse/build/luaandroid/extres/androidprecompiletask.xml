	${basedir} points to the current dir in which this xml is present
	${konyapp.dir} points to Volt MX application base directory
	${app.dir} points to Native android application directory created for the current Volt MX app
	${packagepath} contains the package name folder path relative to src folder
	${build.option} indicates current build is "debug" or "release" mode
	${supportx86} is set to "true" if x86 flag is ticked in IDE build options. 
	${isUniversalApp} is set to "true" for universal build , where both mobile and tablet assets and js files are contained in single apk 
	${isMobileBuild} is set to "true" if current build is invoked for Mobile and 
	 is set to "false" if current build is invoked for Tablet.
	1) Copy this xml to project workspace base directory (using Navigator view in Volt MX)
	${basedir} var then points to project workspace base directory
	2) This xml can be used to perform task such as 
	==> Copy Modified Build xml file to native android folder
	==> Any other custom libs,assets,res files to be copied in to native android hierarchy
	==> Copy any x86 .so files from any libs only when variable ${supportx86} is set to true
	==> Changing or appending some custom paths to project.properties or local.properties etc..
	==> Custom code can be written under {isMobileBuild} check if there are custom tasks to be performed differently for Mobile and Tablet
